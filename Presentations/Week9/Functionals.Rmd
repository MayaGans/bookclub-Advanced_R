## Intro

![_"All Day I Dream About Shiny"_](images/shiny_meme.jpg)

Chapter recaps? Nah, let's build a beer reviews app in Shiny!

Along the way, we'll try to find opportunities to use: 

  * map and friends like map2/pmap, lgl
  * walk
  * modify
  * reduce

I'll be live-coding this, so feel free to chime in with suggestions, critiques, and reminders about forgetting parentheses ()!


## Beer Reviews (an introduction)

This data comes from BeerAdvocate and spans 10+ years of beer reviews on their platform up until Nov 2011, including ~1.5 million reviews. Each review includes ratings in terms of five "aspects": appearance, aroma, palate, taste, and overall impression. Reviews include product and user information, followed by each of these five ratings, and a plaintext review.

I found this set from watching one of [Nick Wan's live-coding Twitch streams](http://twitter.com/nickwan) where he does some really cool live code and DATA SCIENCE on it (unfortunately, he does his coding in Python, but we can't all be perfect!). He had a "recommender model" which did some clustering and similarity scores, so that he could get the model to output "ten beers to try" if you happened to like a specific beer. 

The goal of today's app is to build something that'll collect beer rankings from users (i.e. you guys!) and then compare your reviews with the reviews from the dataset! 

I ***think *** that I can do Shiny app components in the {learnr} package, so we'll give that a spin first but if that doesn't work out, I can always open up a fresh RStudio window to do this `r emo::ji('sunglasses')`

```{r packages_and_data, echo = TRUE}

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(shiny)
library(learnr)
library(arrow)
library(here)
})

beer_reviews <-read_parquet(file = here("data/beer_reviews.pdata")) 

head(beer_reviews)

```



## random shiny demo

You can embed Shiny inputs and outputs in your document. Outputs are automatically updated whenever inputs change.  This demonstrates how a standard R plot can be made interactive by wrapping it in the Shiny `renderPlot` function. The `selectInput` and `sliderInput` functions create the input widgets used to drive the plot.

```{r eruptions, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})

```
