# S4

## 15.2 Basics {-}

:::question
Broadly, what is a generic and method in S4 and what is their relationship? 

```{r}
setClass("Person", 
  slots = c(
    name = "character", 
    age = "numeric"
  )
)

setGeneric("age", function(x) standardGeneric("age"))
setGeneric("age<-", function(x, value) standardGeneric("age<-"))

setMethod("age", "Person", function(x) x@age)
setMethod("age<-", "Person", function(x, value) {
  x@age <- value
  x
})
```

:::question
What is `standardGeneric` doing in the example above? Is this kind of like creating `age.default` for `Person`?
